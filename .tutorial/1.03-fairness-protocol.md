# Protocols

At its heart, Lightning is a **protocol** - a set of rules that dictate how to format, process, and communicate data. In the case of Lightning, this data facilitates the transfer of bitcoin across parties, making Lightning a "payment protocol".

## Understanding Protocols

Protocols act as a universal language that the vast array of computers, which often run on different hardware and software, can use to communicate with each other. This shared language defines the rules for how these devices exchange information. Without protocols, the internet would be like the Tower of Babel - a society unable to communicate because nobody speaks the same language.

For example, the **Internet Protocol (IP)** defines how devices can route packets of data across networks, ensuring they arrive at the correct destination. This is where the term **IP Address** comes from, as every internet-connected device needs an address where it can receive data.

Another popular example of a protocol is the **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**. This protocol enables networked devices to communicate information with each other. For instance, one device can send a GET Request, defined by the HTTP protocol, to another device and ask for information. The receiving device will respond with an HTTP response, including a status code to indicate if the operation was successful or not. 

## Fairness Protocols

A **fairness protocol** is a special kind of protocol. In addition to a shared set of rules, the protocol also has an explicit goal of ensuring fair outcomes among participants - especially in adversarial settings. To accomplish this, fairness protocols often use mechanisms such as incentives and penalties, thus making acting honestly the best strategy. If you attempt to cheat, you will be penalized!

The Lightning Network is a fairness protocol that uses cryptographic mechanisms to enforce fair behavior. If a party attempts to cheat by breaking the rules, the counterparty will have cryptographic proof and can use that proof to punish the cheater. By leveraging cryptography, participants do not need to trust each other or a third party, such as a central authority.

## An Example
For a simple example of a fairness protocol, let's introduce Alice, Bob, and their mom. If you've read Mastering Lightning or have studied game theory, this example should be familiar to you!

Alice and Bob are hungry for cake (who isn't?), but they never play fair when cake is involved. They both try to take as much as they can!

To ensure there is a fair division of cake, we could implement one of the following:

1) **Law**: If you're caught eating more than half of the cake, you are grounded for 100 hours. Ouch!
2) **Trusted Third Parties**: Mom is in charge of splitting the cake and handing the relevant portions to Alice and Bob.
3) **Fairness Protocol**: ....

#### How can we design a fairness protocol such that Alice and Bob do not have to trust each other but still get fair outcomes?

Assuming Alice and Bob both want to maximize the amount of cake they get, Mom can enforce a game, called **"cut and choose"**. In this game, one child plays the role of **"cutter"** and the other child plays the role of **"chooser"**.

The **"cutter"** will begin the game by splitting the cake into two pieces. The **"chooser"** will then select which piece of cake they want. If the **"cutter"** cheats by making one piece larger, the **"chooser"** can punish them by taking the larger piece.

## The Lightning Network
Throughout this course, keep fairness protocols in mind. Much of the Bitcoin wizardry we'll encounter is, at its heart, a way to enforce fair outcomes between multiple entities without a trusted party. Just as "cut and choose" ensures fairness for Alice and Bob, the Lightning Network uses similar principles to achieve trustless cooperation.
