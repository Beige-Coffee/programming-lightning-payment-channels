# ⚡️ Create Received HTLC Script

We're almost finished coding our BOLT 3-compliant Lightning implementation. Let's bring it home by building our **received HTLC script**!

For this exercise, head back to `src/exercises/scripts/htlc.rs`. In this file, you'll find the `create_received_htlc_script` function, which takes the following inputs:

- `revocation_pubkey`: Our **Revocation Public Key**, which is created by combining our counterparty's **Revocation Basepoint** with our **Per-Commitment Point**.
- `local_htlcpubkey`: Our **HTLC Public Key**, which is derived from our **HTLC Basepoint** and our **Per-Commitment Point**.
- `remote_htlcpubkey`: Our counterparty's **HTLC Public Key**, which is derived from their **HTLC Basepoint** and our **Per-Commitment Point**.
- `payment_hash`: The hash of the payment preimage.
- `cltv_expiry`: The absolute block height when this HTLC expires.

```rust
/// Exercise 25: Create received HTLC script
pub fn create_received_htlc_script(
    revocation_pubkey: &PublicKey,
    local_htlcpubkey: &PublicKey,
    remote_htlcpubkey: &PublicKey,
    payment_hash: &[u8; 32],
    cltv_expiry: u32,
) -> ScriptBuf {

    // Hash the payment hash with RIPEMD160

    // Hash the revocation public key with PubkeyHash

    // Build script with three paths: revocation, local with preimage, remote with timeout
    // OP_DUP
    // OP_HASH160
    // <revocation_pubkey_hash>
    // OP_EQUAL
    // OP_IF
    //     OP_CHECKSIG
    // OP_ELSE
    //     <remote_htlcpubkey>
    //     OP_SWAP
    //     OP_SIZE
    //     32
    //     OP_EQUAL
    //     OP_IF
    //         OP_HASH160
    //         <payment_hash160>
    //         OP_EQUALVERIFY
    //         2
    //         OP_SWAP
    //         <local_htlcpubkey>
    //         2
    //         OP_CHECKMULTISIG
    //     OP_ELSE
    //         OP_DROP
    //         <cltv_expiry>
    //         OP_CLTV
    //         OP_DROP
    //         OP_CHECKSIG
    //     OP_ENDIF
    // OP_ENDIF
}
```

  <summary>💡 Hint 💡</summary>

Once again, head back over to the [BOLT 3 specification](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.md#received-htlc-outputs) and try implementing the script exactly as it appears in the BOLT.

The received HTLC script is very similar to the offered HTLC script, but with an important difference: the success path (with preimage) now requires the 2-of-2 multisig, while the timeout path only requires a signature from the remote party.

Here are the `Builder` methods you'll need:

- `Builder::new()`: Creates a new script builder.
- `.push_opcode(opcodes::OP____)`: Pushes an opcode onto the script (e.g., `OP_DUP`, `OP_HASH160`, `OP_IF`, `OP_CHECKSIG`, `OP_CLTV`).
- `.push_slice(&[u8])`: Pushes raw bytes onto the script (e.g., serialized public keys, hashes).
- `.push_int(i64)`: Pushes an integer onto the script (e.g., `2` for the 2-of-2 multisig, or `cltv_expiry` for the timeout).
- `.into_script()`: Converts the builder into a `ScriptBuf`.

You'll also need these helper functions for hashing:

- `Ripemd160::hash(data).to_byte_array()`: Takes the RIPEMD160 hash of data and returns it as a byte array.
- `PubkeyHash::hash(&pubkey.serialize())`: Hashes a serialized public key using HASH160 (SHA256 + RIPEMD160).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 1: Prepare the Hash Values</summary>

Just like we did with the HTLC Offerer script, let's start by preparing two hash values that will be used in the script. The first is the RIPEMD160 of the payment (preimage) hash. The second is the public key hash of the **Revocation Public Key**.
```rust
let payment_hash160 = Ripemd160::hash(payment_hash).to_byte_array();
let revocation_pubkey_hash = PubkeyHash::hash(&revocation_pubkey.serialize());
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 2: Start the Revocation Check</summary>

The revocation path is identical to the offered HTLC. 

We first check if the provided value is equal to the hash of the **Revocation Public Key**. To do this, we use `DUP HASH160 <hash> EQUAL` to check if the two data elements are equal.
```rust
Builder::new()
    .push_opcode(opcodes::OP_DUP)
    .push_opcode(opcodes::OP_HASH160)
    .push_slice(&revocation_pubkey_hash)
    .push_opcode(opcodes::OP_EQUAL)
    .push_opcode(opcodes::OP_IF)
    .push_opcode(opcodes::OP_CHECKSIG)
    .push_opcode(opcodes::OP_ELSE)
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 3: Set Up Success vs Timeout Logic</summary>

Okay, here's where the received HTLC script starts to differ from offered HTLCs!

We still check the witness element size, but the logic is flipped: if the witness element is exactly 32 bytes (preimage), we take the IF branch. Otherwise, we execute the ELSE branch.
```rust
.push_slice(remote_htlcpubkey.serialize())
.push_opcode(opcodes::OP_SWAP)
.push_opcode(opcodes::OP_SIZE)
.push_int(32)
.push_opcode(opcodes::OP_EQUAL)
.push_opcode(opcodes::OP_IF)
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 4: Handle the Success Path (2-of-2 Multisig with Preimage)</summary>

For received HTLCs, we claim the payment (success path) by providing the preimage **and** the signatures required to spend from the 2-of-2 multisig.
```rust
.push_opcode(opcodes::OP_HASH160)
.push_slice(payment_hash160)
.push_opcode(opcodes::OP_EQUALVERIFY)
.push_int(2)
.push_opcode(opcodes::OP_SWAP)
.push_slice(local_htlcpubkey.serialize())
.push_int(2)
.push_opcode(opcodes::OP_CHECKMULTISIG)
.push_opcode(opcodes::OP_ELSE)
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 5: Handle the Timeout Path (with CLTV)</summary>

If there's no preimage, then the counterparty (Alice) can simply reclaim their funds after the CLTV expiry.
```rust
.push_opcode(opcodes::OP_DROP)
.push_int(cltv_expiry as i64)
.push_opcode(opcodes::OP_CLTV)
.push_opcode(opcodes::OP_DROP)
.push_opcode(opcodes::OP_CHECKSIG)
.push_opcode(opcodes::OP_ENDIF)
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 6: Close the Outer Conditional</summary>

Finally, we close the outer IF/ELSE structure.
```rust
.push_opcode(opcodes::OP_ENDIF)
.into_script();
```

</details>


# ⚡️ Create HTLC Success Transaction

Next up, let's build the **HTLC Success Transaction**! As we just learned, this is the counterpart to the HTLC Timeout Transaction - it enables Bob to claim a received HTLC when he obtains the payment preimage.

For this exercise, head over to `src/exercises/transactions/htlc.rs`.

The `create_htlc_success_transaction` function takes the following parameters:

- `htlc_outpoint`: The outpoint (txid + vout) of the HTLC output we're spending from. 
- `htlc_amount`: The amount locked in the HTLC (in satoshis).
- `local_keys`: Our commitment keys. See the dropdown below for more information.
- `to_self_delay`: The number of blocks that we must wait before we can claim our funds using the **Delayed Payment Public Key** path.
- `feerate_per_kw`: The fee rate in satoshis per 1000 weight units.

```rust
/// Exercise 26: Create HTLC-success transaction
pub fn create_htlc_success_transaction(
    htlc_outpoint: OutPoint,
    htlc_amount: u64,
    local_keys: &CommitmentKeys,
    to_self_delay: u16,
    feerate_per_kw: u64,
) -> Transaction {
    // Calculate fee and output amount
    let fee = calculate_htlc_success_tx_fee(feerate_per_kw);
    let output_amount = htlc_amount.saturating_sub(fee);

    // Create a secp256k1 context

    // Create to_local script for the output

    // Build transaction with no locktime (immediate claim with preimage)

}
```

<details>
  <summary>💡 Hint 💡</summary>

This function is very similar to `create_htlc_timeout_transaction`, which we implemented a few exercises ago. The main difference is that the **HTLC Success Transaction** has **no locktime**!

Below are a few hints to help you on your journey.

1. **Calculate the fee and output amount**
   - Use `calculate_htlc_success_tx_fee(feerate_per_kw)` to get the fee. Note that this is a different function than the one we used for the Timeout Transaction, since the Success Transaction is slightly larger (it includes the preimage in the witness).

2. **Determine output amount**
   - Subtract the fee from `htlc_amount`.

3. **Create the output script**
   - The output uses the same `to_local` script structure we built earlier. You can use the `create_to_local_script()` function!

4. **Build the transaction input**
   - Create a `TxIn` with the following fields:
     - `previous_output`: Set to `htlc_outpoint`
     - `script_sig`: Empty (`ScriptBuf::new()`) since this is SegWit
     - `sequence`: Set to `Sequence::ZERO`
     - `witness`: Empty for now (`Witness::new()`)

5. **Build the transaction output**
   - Create a `TxOut` with the following fields:
     - `value`: Use `Amount::from_sat(output_amount)`
     - `script_pubkey`: Use the script you just created! Make sure to call `.to_p2wsh()`.

6. **Build the `Transaction` struct** with:
   - `version: Version::TWO`
   - `lock_time: LockTime::ZERO` - Unlike the Timeout Transaction, there's no absolute timelock!
   - `input`: A vector containing each `TxIn`
   - `output`: A vector containing each `TxOut`

7. **Return the transaction!**

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 1: Calculate Fees and Output Amount</summary>

Just like we did for the **HTLC Timeout Transaction**, we'll start by calculating the fee for the **HTLC Success Transaction**. However, we'll use a different function this time, as the **HTLC Success Transaction** will be larger since it includes a preimage in the witness.

A helper function, `calculate_htlc_success_tx_fee`, is available for this exercise. You can see the function definition below or view it in `src/exercises/transactions/fees.rs`.

Once we have the fee for this transaction, which depends on the feerate, we'll determine the output amount by subtracting it from the `htlc_amount`. 
```rust
let fee = calculate_htlc_success_tx_fee(feerate_per_kw);
let output_amount = htlc_amount.saturating_sub(fee);
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 2: Create the to_local Output Script</summary>

Similar to the **HTLC Timeout Transaction**, the **HTLC Success Transaction** pays to a `to_local` script.
```rust
let to_local_script = create_to_local_script(
    &local_keys.revocation_key,
    &local_keys.local_delayed_payment_key,
    to_self_delay,
);
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 3: Create the Transaction Input</summary>

Next, let's define our HTLC Success input! Similar to the Timeout Transaction, we'll keep it unsigned, so we just need to create a `TxIn` object.
```rust
let tx_in = TxIn {
    previous_output: htlc_outpoint,
    script_sig: ScriptBuf::new(),
    sequence: Sequence::ZERO,
    witness: Witness::new(),
};
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 4: Create the Transaction Output</summary>

Now, let's create a `TxOut` object. Remember to cast the `ScriptBuf` to a P2WSH output (`.to_p2wsh()`)!
```rust
let tx_out = TxOut {
    value: Amount::from_sat(output_amount),
    script_pubkey: to_local_script.to_p2wsh(),
};
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 5: Assemble the Complete Transaction</summary>

Go ahead and create the complete `Transaction`! The notable difference between this exercise and the Timeout Transaction is that there is no locktime expiry!
```rust
Transaction {
    version: Version::TWO,
    lock_time: LockTime::ZERO,
    input: vec![tx_in],
    output: vec![tx_out],
}
```

</details>


# ⚡️ Finalize HTLC Success Transaction

Nice, our HTLC Success functionality is almost done! Now, just like we did with our HTLC Timeout Transaction, we need to write code to generate our signature and build the witness for our HTLC Success Transaction.

For this exercise, we'll complete `finalize_htlc_success`, which takes the following parameters:

- `keys_manager`: Our `ChannelKeysManager`, which holds our HTLC Basepoint Secret and can generate signatures.
- `tx`: The unsigned HTLC Success Transaction we created earlier.
- `input_index`: The index of the input we're signing on the HTLC Success Transaction.
- `htlc_script`: The received HTLC script that we're spending from.
- `htlc_amount`: The amount in the HTLC output (needed for signature generation).
- `remote_htlc_signature`: Our counterparty's signature (pre-signed when the HTLC was created).
- `payment_preimage`: The 32-byte preimage that unlocks the HTLC.

Go ahead and try implementing the function below! To successfully complete this exercise, you'll need to generate the (local) HTLC signature and then add the following witness to the transaction.
```
0 <remotehtlcsig> <localhtlcsig> <payment_preimage> htlc_script
```

```rust
/// Exercise 27: Finalize HTLC-success transaction
pub fn finalize_htlc_success(
    keys_manager: ChannelKeyManager,
    tx: Transaction,
    input_index: usize,
    htlc_script: &ScriptBuf,
    htlc_amount: u64,
    remote_htlc_signature: Vec<u8>,
    payment_preimage: [u8; 32],
) -> Transaction {

    // Get the local HTLC private key

    // Sign the transaction input with the local HTLC private key

    // Build witness: [0, remote_sig, local_sig, preimage, script]

    // Attach witness to transaction

    // Return Transaction

}
```

<details>
  <summary>💡 Hint 💡</summary>

This function is very similar to `finalize_htlc_timeout`, which we recently implemented. The key difference is the witness structure. Instead of an empty byte array for the timeout path, we provide the **payment preimage**!

Here are a few hints to get you going:

1. **Get the HTLC private key**
   - Fetch the `htlc_basepoint_secret` from the `keys_manager`.

2. **Generate the local HTLC signature**
   - Use `keys_manager.sign_transaction_input_sighash_all()` with the following arguments:
     - `&tx`: The transaction we're signing.
     - `input_index`: The index of the input.
     - `&htlc_script`: The HTLC script we're spending from.
     - `htlc_amount`: The amount in the HTLC output.
     - `&local_htlc_privkey`: The HTLC private key.

3. **Build the witness stack**
   - The witness for the HTLC Success path follows this structure: `0 <remotehtlcsig> <localhtlcsig> <payment_preimage> htlc_script`
   - The preimage is exactly 32 bytes, which tells the script interpreter to take the success path (the IF branch that checks `OP_SIZE 32 OP_EQUAL`).

4. **Attach the witness to the transaction**
   - Create a mutable copy of the transaction.
   - Set `signed_tx.input[0].witness` to the witness we just built.

5. **Return the signed transaction!**

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 1: Fetch the Local HTLC Private Key</summary>

Since we'll need to generate our own signature, using the **HTLC Basepoint Secret**, we'll need to start by fetching the secret from our `ChannelKeyManager`. You can click the dropdown below if you need a reminder of the `ChannelKeyManager` structure.

<details>
  <summary>ChannelKeyManager</summary>
    
```rust
pub struct ChannelKeyManager {
    pub funding_key: SecretKey,
    pub revocation_basepoint_secret: SecretKey,
    pub payment_basepoint_secret: SecretKey,
    pub delayed_payment_basepoint_secret: SecretKey,
    pub htlc_basepoint_secret: SecretKey,
    pub commitment_seed: [u8; 32],
    pub secp_ctx: Secp256k1<All>,
}
```

</details>

```rust
let local_htlc_privkey = keys_manager.htlc_basepoint_secret;
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 2: Sign the Transaction Input</summary>

Next, let's generate our signature for the HTLC receiver output on our commitment transaction. To do this, we can use the `sign_transaction_input_sighash_all` function we created earlier in this course.

<details>
  <summary>Click to see sign_transaction_input_sighash_all function definition</summary>

We implemented the `sign_transaction_input_sighash_all` function earlier in this course. You may not have implemented it *exactly* like the below example, which is okay! That said, here is an example implementation to help jog your memory as you complete this exercise.

```rust
impl ChannelKeyManager {
    pub fn sign_transaction_input_sighash_all(
        &self,
        tx: &Transaction,
        input_index: usize,
        script: &ScriptBuf,
        amount: u64,
        secret_key: &SecretKey,
    ) -> Vec<u8> {
        // Compute the sighash for the P2WSH input
        let mut sighash_cache = SighashCache::new(tx);

        // Compute the P2WSH signature hash
        let sighash = sighash_cache
            .p2wsh_signature_hash(
                input_index,
                script,
                Amount::from_sat(amount),
                EcdsaSighashType::All,
            )
            .expect("Valid sighash");

        // Convert sighash to Message
        let msg = Message::from_digest(sighash.to_byte_array());

        // Sign the Message with secret_key
        let sig = self.secp_ctx.sign_ecdsa(&msg, secret_key);

        // Serialize signature and append SIGHASH_ALL flag (EcdsaSighashType::All)
        let mut sig_bytes = sig.serialize_der().to_vec();
        sig_bytes.push(EcdsaSighashType::All as u8);
        sig_bytes
    }
}
```

</details>

```rust
let local_htlc_signature = keys_manager.sign_transaction_input_sighash_all(
    &tx,
    input_index,
    &htlc_script,
    htlc_amount,
    &local_htlc_privkey,
);
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 3: Build the Witness Stack</summary>

Now, let's build the witness stack!

```rust
let witness = Witness::from_slice(&[
    &[][..],                        // OP_0 for CHECKMULTISIG bug
    &remote_htlc_signature[..],
    &local_htlc_signature[..],
    &payment_preimage[..],          // The 32-byte preimage for success path
    htlc_script.as_bytes(),
]);
```

Below is a breakdown of each element:

1. **Empty byte array (`&[][..]`)**: First, we need to add a dummy element to the stack (`OP_0`), since there is an `OP_CHECKMULTISIG` bug that pops an extra item off the stack.

2. **Remote HTLC signature**: Next, we add our counterparty's pre-signed signature. Remember, they give this to us when we are setting up the HTLC!

3. **Local HTLC signature**: Then we add our signature, which we just created.

4. **Payment preimage (`&payment_preimage[..]`)**: This is the key difference from the witness we created for the Timeout Transaction! Since the preimage is exactly 32 bytes, it will cause the Bitcoin Script interpreter to evaluate the success path (IF branch). The interpreter will then hash the preimage and check if it matches the payment hash.

```
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <RIPEMD160(SHA256(revocationpubkey))> OP_EQUAL
OP_IF
    OP_CHECKSIG
OP_ELSE
    <remote_htlcpubkey> OP_SWAP OP_SIZE 32 OP_EQUAL
    OP_IF
        # To local node via HTLC-success transaction.
        OP_HASH160 <RIPEMD160(payment_hash)> OP_EQUALVERIFY
        2 OP_SWAP <local_htlcpubkey> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
```

5. **HTLC script**: Finally, we provide the full received HTLC script.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 4: Insert Witness into the Transaction</summary>

Lastly, we'll add the witness to the transaction's input.

Don't forget to return the signed transaction!

```rust
let mut signed_tx = tx;
signed_tx.input[0].witness = witness;

signed_tx
```
