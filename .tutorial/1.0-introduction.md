# Welcome to Programming Lightning: Intro to Payment Channels

Welcome! If you're interested in learning how Bitcoin's Lightning Network works, you've come to the right place. Programming Lightning is a comprehensive course that teaches you how the Lightning Network works by guiding you through building a payment channel from scratch.

By the end of this course, your implementation will even pass some of the main [BOLT 3 Test Vectors](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.md#appendix-b-funding-transaction-test-vectors). Test Vectors are pre-defined inputs and expected outputs that help developers ensure their code aligns with the protocol specification. When your implementation passes these test vectors, it means your code is correct, and your implementation is on its way to being interoperable with other Lightning implementations such as LND, LDK, Eclair, and Core Lightning.

In this course, we'll build payment channels from the ground up, starting with our Lightning wallet. Once we have that foundation, we'll explore the simplest possible payment channel and examine its limitations. Then, step by step, we'll address each weakness and build toward a full, BOLT-compliant Lightning channel in all its glory.

# Prerequisites

This course assumes you have already read or understand the information contained in **Mastering Bitcoin** and/or **Programming Bitcoin**. To get the most out of this course, you should have a working understanding of Bitcoin transactions and script. If you'd like to brush up beforehand, here are a few excellent resources:
- Script (Free): https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/script/
- Transactions (Free): https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/transaction/
- Transactions + Script ($120): https://www.udemy.com/course/base58-bitcoin-transactions-one/

# Replit

While Programming Lightning is open source and can be completed locally on your machine, it's likely easiest to complete the course on Replit. Once you fork (aka "Remix") the **Programming Lightning: Intro to Payment Channels** Repl, you'll be able to open the workshop. It's recommended to use a **2-pane setup** with the **Tutorial** on one side and the following tabs on the other side:
- `src/exercises/transactions.txt`
- Replit Shell
- Replit Console

**This is what that would look like**:

# Rust
This workshop relies heavily on the Rust programming language and ecosystem. For this section of Programming Lightning, **Intro to Payment Channels**, we will be using [**Rust Bitcoin**](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin) and do not assume *any* prior knowledge of Rust. 

# Course Exercises

As you work through the course, you will come across emojis that signal an exercise is coming up.  Here's a quick overview of what you will see and what each emoji means:

### Command Line Exercise

👉 This emoji means the following console command should be copied and pasted into your **Shell**:
```
// some command or code will be here, with a copy button on the right ->
```

### Coding Exercises
⚡️ You'll see a lightning bolt when it's time to start a programming exercise. All programming exercises in this course will have the following two types of dropdowns, which you can use to help you complete each exercise.
1. **💡 Hint 💡**: Provides useful tips and direction to help you complete the exercises, but it does not provide the answer itself.
2. **Step-By-Step Instructions**: Provides detailed directions for how to complete the exercise.

# A Special Thanks
Throughout this course, you'll see many transaction diagrams designed to help you understand what's going on "under the hood" while providing enough abstraction to see the bigger picture. These diagrams are based on ones created by **Elle Mouton** in her article, [Opening and announcing a pre-taproot LN channel](https://ellemouton.com/posts/open_channel_pre_taproot/). Elle's diagrams are, by far, the clearest and most concise transaction visuals I've seen. I encourage you to visit her blog!
