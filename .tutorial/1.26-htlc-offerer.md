# HTLC Offerer

Alright, we're getting a little ahead of ourselves! We've learned how to **add** and **remove** HLTCs, but we haven't learned what a Lightning HTLC actually looks like yet.

There are a few reasons we've pushed this off. First, the HTLC script will change depending on if you're **offering** or **receiving** the HTLC. Second, the scripts are pretty... complicated.

In our ongoing example, Alice is **offering** the HTLC, since she is attempting to make a payment through Bob. On the other hand, Bob is **receiving** the HTLC, since he is accepting the HTLC and, if successful, the HTLC funds would be moved to Bob's side of the channel.

## HTLC Offerer Pseudo Script

The HTLC scripts are not easy on the eyes, so let's inch our way towards them, starting with pseudo script. As a reminder, "pseudo script" means we'll be writing the script in plain English, describing the spending paths that will eventually need to be implemented in Bitcoin's native programming language, [**Script**](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script).

Alice, the ***HTLC offerer***, has to create an HTLC output where:

1. **Bob** can spend the output if he has the **Revocation Private Key** for this specific commitment state. This protects Bob in the future if Alice attempts to cheat by publishing this HTLC commitment transaction **after** they have agreed to move to a new channel state.
2. **Bob** can spend the output if he has the **preimage**.
3. **Alice** can spend (effectively, reclaim) the output if the **HTLC expires**. Remember, Alice proposed a block height at which the HTLC expires.

</p>

**This is very nuanced, but there's actually a dilemma here!** The HTLC expiry path has two conflicting timelock requirements:

1. **Absolute Timelock** (`OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY`): The HTLC must expire at a specific block height (`cltv_expiry`). This ensures Bob can safely forward the HTLC without worrying that Alice will arbitrarily expire the contract early.

2. **Relative Timelock** (`OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY`): Alice's spending path must be delayed by `to_self_delay` blocks to give Bob time to claim the funds via the Revocation Path if Alice cheats.

#### Question: Can you spot the problem with combining these two timelocks in the same output script?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

The issue is that the **relative timelock** doesn't start counting until the transaction is mined. But the transaction can't be mined until *after* the **absolute timelock** is satisfied.

This means, in the worst case, if Alice times out the HTLC right when the contract expires at `cltv_expiry`, **she still has to wait another `to_self_delay` blocks before she can actually spend the output**. This gives Bob extra time beyond what the HTLC expiry intended.

While this might seem like it just inconveniences Alice, it actually creates a problem for the entire payment route's timelock calculations. Do you know how we can fix this?

</details>

## Addressing The Dilemma

To fix this timelock dilemma, we'll add a second transaction for Alice, known as the **HTLC Timeout Transaction**. This transaction will use the same script as our `to_local` output, but with the following differences:

1. The transaction will have a `locktime` set to the **HTLC's block height expiration**, known as `cltv_expiry` (Check Locktime Verify Expiry) in the protocol. This means the transaction cannot be mined until the `cltv_expiry` block height has passed.
2. The **input** for this transaction will be the **HTLC output** from the commitment transaction.
3. The HTLC Timeout Transaction will spend from a **2-of-2 multisig path in the commitment transaction's HTLC output script**. Therefore, it will require signatures from both Alice and Bob. **Alice and Bob will pre-sign the HTLC Timeout Transaction when creating the HTLC output on their commitment transactions**, effectively agreeing to the "expiry" terms of the contract.
   - ❗NOTE: As we'll see shortly, the public keys used for the 2-of-2 multisig (and the associated signatures) are derived from the **HTLC Basepoint**.

Remember how the `commitment_signed` message had a field for `htlc_signatures`, and we said we'd discuss it later? Well, now it's "later"!

When Alice and Bob add new HTLCs to their commitment transactions, they exchange the signatures needed to spend from the HTLC output using the HTLC Timeout Transaction. SPOILER ALERT: Bob will also have a second HTLC transaction for his version of the commitment transaction, called the **"HTLC Success Transaction"**, which is why Alice sends him an HTLC signature.

In the diagram below, you'll see that when adding an HTLC and moving to a new channel state, Bob sends Alice an HTLC Signature, which Alice will use in her **HTLC Timeout Transaction** if she needs to publish it on-chain. Bob is able to create Alice's **HTLC Timeout Transaction** locally and send her the signature because he has all the information he needs to do so. Remember, Alice gave Bob her **Delayed Payment Basepoint** and **Revocation Basepoint** when they opened the channel, and Alice sent Bob the `cltv_expiry` in the `update_add_htlc` message, so Bob has everything he needs to generate the signature.

</details>

Together, these updates allow Alice to enforce both the **absolute timelock** and the **relative timelock**. This is because Alice cannot publish the **HTLC Timeout Transaction** until the HTLC expires at block height `cltv_expiry` (the absolute timelock). Once published, she must wait an additional `to_self_delay` blocks before claiming her funds (the relative timelock via `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY`).

## Putting It All Together

As a brief review, the HTLC output has the following spending conditions:

1. **Revocation Path**: If Bob has the revocation secret (in case Alice cheats by broadcasting an old transaction), he can immediately claim the output.
2. **Preimage Path**: If Bob has the preimage, he can immediately claim the output.
3. **Expiry Path**: If the HTLC expires, Alice can claim the output via the **2-of-2 multisig path**, which must be claimed using the **HTLC Timeout Transaction**. This allows Alice to expire the HTLC and reclaim her funds - while also enforcing the `to_self_delay`.

For the HTLC Timeout Transaction, we have the following spending paths:

- **Revocation Path**: Bob can claim the output immediately with the revocation secret.
- **Delayed Path**: Alice can claim the output after the `to_self_delay`.

</p>

Now that we can see the full HTLC script, let's draw attention to the **`OP_CHECKMULTISIG`** spending path, which sends to the **HTLC Timeout Transaction**. If Bob does not cooperate to "unwind" the HTLC by either fulfilling or failing it, then Alice's only option to expire the HTLC is to publish the **HTLC Timeout Transaction**. Since the **HTLC Timeout Transaction** requires one signature from Alice and one from Bob, both parties effectively agree on the expiry terms when they exchange signatures during the process of adding the HTLC. This way, Bob can rest assured that Alice is only able to expire the HTLC using the **HTLC Timeout Transaction**, which Bob knows has an absolute timelock set to `cltv_expiry`.

## Deriving HTLC Keys

Now that we understand the HTLC scripts, let's review how the HTLC public keys are derived.

### Public Keys

HTLC public keys are derived exactly the same way as the **Delayed Payment Public Keys** we reviewed earlier. As a reminder, here's the formula:

```
pubkey = basepoint + SHA256(per_commitment_point || basepoint) * G
```

Where:
- `basepoint`: The basepoint of the key you're deriving (e.g., **Delayed Payment Basepoint**, **HTLC Basepoint**)
- `per_commitment_point`: The **Per-Commitment Point** for the specific commitment transaction

### Private Keys

The corresponding private keys are derived the same way, but using the **Basepoint Secrets** instead of the **Basepoints**:

```
privkey = basepoint_secret + SHA256(per_commitment_point || basepoint)
```

### Question: What should we do if Alice wants to forward a payment that is below the dust limit?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

If you've ever used Lightning to send a small payment, such as 1 sat, you know firsthand that it's **possible** to send payments that are below the dust limit. However, it doesn't make sense to add an output for such a payment, as creating the output would cost more than the output is worth!

That's why, per [BOLT 3](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.md#commitment-transaction-outputs), any HTLC payments (minus fees) below the `dust_limit_satoshis` threshold are added to the transaction fees during routing. It's worth elaborating on two things:

- `dust_limit_satoshis` is specified by each channel party, allowing them to set **their own** threshold for amounts they won't create commitment outputs for. If the two parties have different dust limits, their commitment transactions won't be identical: one might include an HTLC output, while the other "trims" it (adding the value to fees instead). This is a neat feature of Lightning that is enabled by the fact that commitments are asymmetric. Since Alice and Bob exchange fee-related information when they start their channel, they will know each other's dust limit and create their signatures (which they send to each other) appropriately.
- When determining if an HTLC is below the dust limit, you must also factor in fees for the second-stage transaction **if your Lightning channel does not support anchor outputs or zero fee commitments**. For example, if you're routing a payment for 600 sats, but the second-stage HTLC Timeout Transaction fees are 300 sats, your resulting P2WSH output would be below the P2WSH dust threshold of 330 satoshis. You can view the various dust thresholds in BOLT 3 [here](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.md#dust-limits).

Below is a diagram showcasing how to calculate fees for the second-stage HTLC transaction. Remember, if the Lightning channel supports anchor outputs or zero-fee commitments, then you do not need to include fees on this transaction, as they can be included later. However, if a Lightning channel does not support anchor outputs or zero fee commitments, then you should trim HTLCs if, when including second-stage fees, the amount is below the dust threshold.

> *NOTE*: If your Lightning channel supports zero fee commitments, then trimmed HTLCs are added to the shared anchor output, until it reaches 240 sats.
