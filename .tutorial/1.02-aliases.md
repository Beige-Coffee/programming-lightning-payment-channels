# Aliases
The workbook comes with a couple of aliases that will be useful as we begin to program Lightning. Each alias executes a Bitcoin remote procedure call (RPC) command under the hood, interacting with **bitcoind** (which runs in the background of this Repl). These aliases are designed to simplify executing each command, and links to the underlying documentation for each command are also provided. Before we dive in, let's take a minute to get familiar with them and try a few out.
## Mine blocks
For a transaction to be confirmed in the blockchain, it will need to be included in a block. To do this, you can use the alias below. For this workshop, we'll mine blocks to open and close our lightning channels. [See documentation.](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/generatetoaddress.html?highlight=generatetoaddress)
👉 Try mining a block!
```
mine 1
```
Technically, this command will also send bitcoin to our on-chain wallet. So you can use this command if you need some on-chain funds.
## Broadcast Raw Transaction
👉 Broadcast a raw transaction. [See documentation.](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/sendrawtransaction.html)
```
sendtx <raw tx hex>
```
## Decode Raw Transaction
👉 Decode a raw transaction so that it's easy to see the various inputs, outputs, and other transaction information. [See documentation.](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/decoderawtransaction.html)
```
decodetx <raw tx hex>
```
## Get Transaction
👉 Retrieve information about a broadcast transaction. [See documentation.](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/gettransaction.html?highlight=gettransaction)
```
gettx <tx id>
```
## Get UTXO
👉 Retrieve information about a UTXO. If no information is returned, that UTXO does not exist. [See documentation.](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/gettxout.html)
```
getutxo <tx id> <output index>
```
